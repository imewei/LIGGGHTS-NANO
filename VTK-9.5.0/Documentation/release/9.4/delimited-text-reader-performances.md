## Delimited Text Reader Performances

vtkDelimitedTextReader memory footprint is now much lower during computation.
(i.e. inside the `RequestData`, called from `Update`)
Also, speedup are expected (due to the drastic diminution of allocations)

While it used to store the whole data as string before doing the conversion
to numeric values (if relevant) leading to data duplication at some point
of the process, it now performs conversion on the fly.

There is no change once `RequestData` return, also no change in the output
`vtkTable`.
This is a memory reduction *during the read process*.

Early tests with a 100k lines and 9 columns csv file through heaptrack
gives the following:

| version | peak memory | peak contribution | calls to allocation | duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| master | 58.5 MB | 41.9 MB from `vtkStringArray` | 1,042,111 | 0.873 s |
| this topic | 17.9 MB | 6.3 MB from `vtkBuffer` | 39,784 | 0.344 s |
